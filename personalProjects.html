			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Apart from this website I have a number of other personal projects that allowed me to test and develop my skills further. I will list some of the more major projects here.

			<h1>Spacecrafts</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Spacecrafts is a game developed for Android. The source code is written in C# and in order to link the assets I used the game engine Unity. The game is fully functional and with space thematic. I developed the project in high school in order to improve my C# programming skills.

				The game can be downloaded from <a href = "https://gamejolt.com/games/Spacecrafts/342021">here</a>
