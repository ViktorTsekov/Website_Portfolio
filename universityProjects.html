			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				In my programming module in university we were developing a number of different projects. I will list some of the more major projects here.
			</p>

			<h1>Super Mario Knockoff</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				One of our final projects in my first year of university was the development of a simple platforming game using C language. Since the task was about creating a platforming game I wanted my character to be an icon from the genre and thats why I chose him to be Super Mario. The game mechanics are also mostly the same.
				<br> <br>
				The repository with the source code of the game can be found <a href = "https://github.com/ViktorTsekov/Super_Mario_Knockoff">here</a>
